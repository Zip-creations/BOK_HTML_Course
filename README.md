This project was created by Ruben Rosenmeyer over the course of 3 weeks for the BOK-course "Einführung in die Entwicklung von Webseiten mit HTML5 und CSS3" at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg.
The course was taught by Michaela Teichmann during the winter term 2023/2024.
The assignment was the creation of a responsive, interactive webpage for any city district of Freiburg. I chose Betzenhausen, as this was my home district at the time.
This was my first project using HTML/CSS and Javascript.
